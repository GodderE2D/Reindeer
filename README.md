# Installing

> **Note:** If you just want to use the publicly hosted version of the bot, you can invite it from
> [the website](https://reindeer.bsr.gg/).

To locally install the bot yourself (e.g. if you want to contribute or self-host), follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.11.0 or later
- Yarn classic (1.22.19)
- A Discord application and bot
- A PostgreSQL database (to run one locally, see [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html))

## Setup

Once you've cloned the repository from GitHub, install the required Node dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and fill out the environment variables listed inside.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Push the Prisma schema to your Postgres database.

```sh
yarn push

# If you don't have a database yet, you can still generate typings
yarn generate
```

Compile the bot with tsc. Leave this terminal tab open while developing the bot. In production, you can use `yarn build`
instead.

```sh
# Development (watch mode)
yarn build:dev

# Production
yarn build
```

Finally, you can run the bot using nodemon in development or pm2 in production.

```sh
# Development
yarn dev

# Production
pm2 start dist/index.js

# Or, just using node
yarn start
```
